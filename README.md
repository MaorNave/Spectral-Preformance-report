# Spectral-Preformance-report
Spectral performance report Elbit - Professor Eyal Ben-Dor &amp; Elop algo team, first reference on a study.

My very first reference:

"In conclusion, the spectral resampling technique applied in this study showed promising results in reducing the noise effect and achieving a wider hypothetical full width-at-half-maximum using fewer bands." Written by Professor Eyal Ben-Dor , TLV university, Faculty of Exact science.

Yep, that’s our new technique:
As part of our development process to reach robust deep learning computer vision model that can detect objects with cutting-edge imaging range, our algo team focuses on giving new insights from any material Hyperspectral signature that found on earth.
After a long research on the field, I developed a new approach for extracting the most informative data for our deep learning models, based on our multispectral sensors.

To many more references to come.

*P.S — due to work boundaries , attached only conclusion and references of the report.
